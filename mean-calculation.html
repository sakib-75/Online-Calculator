            <h3 class="item-title">Mean (Average)</h3>
            <p>The mean (average) of a data set is found by adding all numbers in the data set and then dividing by the
                number of values in the set. The word mean, which is a homonym for multiple other words in the English
                language, is similarly ambiguous even in the area of mathematics. Depending on the context, whether
                mathematical or statistical, what is meant by the "mean" changes. In its simplest mathematical
                definition regarding data sets, the mean used is the arithmetic mean, also referred to as mathematical
                expectation, or average. In this form, the mean refers to an intermediate value between a discrete set
                of numbers, namely, the sum of all values in the data set, divided by the total number of values. The
                equation for calculating the arithmetic mean is virtually identical to that for calculating the
                statistical concepts of population and sample mean, with slight variations in the variables used:</p>
            <img src="images/mean.png" alt="">

            <h3 class="item-title">Geometric Mean</h3>
            <p>The geometric mean in mathematics is a type of average that uses the product of the values in a set to
                indicate central tendency. This is in contrast to the arithmetic mean that performs the same function
                using the sum of the values in the set rather than their products. The geometric mean is useful in cases
                where the values being compared vary largely. Imagine a car that is rated on a scale of 0-5 for fuel
                efficiency, and a scale of 0-100 for safety. If the arithmetic means were used, the safety of the
                vehicle would be given far more weight, since a small percentage change on a larger scale will result in
                a larger difference than a large percentage change on a smaller scale; a change of fuel efficiency
                rating from 2 to 5 which is a 250% increase in rating would be overshadowed by a 6.25% rating change of
                80 to 85 if only the arithmetic mean were considered. The geometric mean accounts for this by
                normalizing the ranges being averaged, resulting in none of the ranges dominating the weighting. Unlike
                the arithmetic mean, any given percentage change in the geometric mean has the same effect on the
                geometric mean. The equation for calculating the geometric mean is as follows:</p>

            <h3 class="item-title">Median</h3>
            <p>In statistics and probability theory, the median is the value separating the higher half from the lower
                half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of
                as "the middle" value. The basic feature of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often
                simply described as the "average") is that it is not skewed by a small proportion of extremely large or
                small values, and therefore provides a better representation of a "typical" value. Median income, for
                example, may be a better way to suggest what a "typical" income is, because income distribution can be
                very skewed. The median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant
                statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the
                median is not an arbitrarily large or small result.</p>

            <div class="mode-law">
                <h3 class="item-title">Mode</h3>
                <p>Mode means a value or a number that appears most frequently in a dataset. Sometimes we may need to
                    find
                    the value, which is occurring more frequently in the dataset. In such cases, we find the mode for
                    the
                    set of given data. There may or may not be a modal value for a given set of data. For data without
                    any
                    repeating values, there might be no mode at all. Also, we can find data with only one mode, two
                    modes,
                    three modes, or multiple modes. This depends on the given dataset.</p>
                <h4>Mode = L + (fm−f1)h /(fm−f1)+(fm−f2)</h4>
                <p>Where,</p>

                    <li><b>L</b>= Lower limit Mode of modal class</li>
                    <li><b>fm </b>= Frequency of modal class</li>
                    <li><b>f1</b> = Frequency of class preceding the modal class</li>
                    <li><b>f2</b>= Frequency of class succeeding the modal class</li>
                    <li><b>h</b> = Size of class interval</li>

                <h3 class="item-title">Standard Deviation</h3>
                <p>Standard deviation is a useful measure of spread for normal distributions.In normal distributions,
                    data is symmetrically distributed with no skew. Most values cluster around
                    a central region, with values tapering off as they go further away from the center. The standard
                    deviation tells you how spread out from the center of the distribution your data is on average. Many
                    scientific variables follow normal distributions, including height, standardized test scores,
                    or job satisfaction ratings. When you have the standard deviations of different samples, you can
                    compare their distributions using statistical tests to make inferences about the larger populations
                    they came from.</p>
                <img src="images/Job-satisfaction-ratings-of-three-groups.svg" class="std-img" alt="">
                <p>The standard deviation reflects the dispersion of the distribution. The curve with the lowest
                    standard deviation has a high peak and a small spread, while the curve with the highest standard
                    deviation is more flat and widespread. Different formulas are used for calculating standard
                    deviations depending on whether you have data from a whole population or a sample.</p>

                    population that you’re interested in, you can get an exact value for population standard deviation.
